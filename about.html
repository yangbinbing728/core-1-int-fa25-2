  <section class="about-section">
    <h2>Welcome!</h2>
    <p>
      Thank you for visiting my amusement park.  
      This place was created so you can easily explore the world I imagined —  
      a playful, vibrant, emotional space where each “ride” is made from my ideas,
      artworks, and memories.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section class="about-section">
    <h2>What Kind of Amusement Park Is This?</h2>
    <p>
      This is not a traditional theme park with roller coasters and ticket lines.
      Instead, it is a digital park built with images, sound, movement, and mood.
      Every corner holds a small surprise.  
      Some parts are energetic and bright; others are dreamy, soft, or mysterious.
      The goal is to create a place where imagination feels real —  
      a park that is made of feelings instead of machines.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section class="about-section">
    <h2>What Can You Do Here?</h2>
    <p>
      Wander around freely.  
      Follow your curiosity.  
      Click on any “ride” you like — each one will take you into a different zone of my world.
      You might find motion, color, small stories, or simply the atmosphere of a moment.  
      There is no right or wrong way to explore.  
      This park is meant to be discovered slowly, like you are walking through it at night.
    </p>

  <section class="about-section">
    <h2>Why I Made This</h2>
    <p>
      I wanted to build a place that feels comforting, playful, and a little magical —
      somewhere you can escape to for a moment, even through a screen.
      Every ride and image comes from things I love, things I remember,
      and things that inspired me while creating this world.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section class="about-section closing">
    <p>
      I hope this amusement park brings you a sense of discovery,  
      a spark of joy,  
      or simply a moment to breathe.  
      Thank you for stepping inside —  
      the park is now yours to explore.
