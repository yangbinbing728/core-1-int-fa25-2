    <h1>The Haunted Manor</h1>
    <p>
        Hidden behind drifting fog and old iron gates, the Haunted Manor waits in silence. 
        Its crooked windows glow faintly, as if someone—or something—is still watching from inside. 
        Every step closer feels like crossing a line you can't come back from.

        <p>
            The moment you enter, the temperature drops.  
            Faint whispers echo through the halls as shadows stretch across the floor on their own.  
            The walls feel alive—breathing, listening, remembering every visitor who've stepped inside.  
            It’s not just a walkthrough… it’s a descent into a story that follows you long after you leave.

    <h3>Appearance and Structure</h3>
    <p>
        The manor stands tall with fractured stone walls and wooden beams twisted by time. 
        Flickering lanterns swing above the entrance, casting long trembling shadows. 
        Inside, the corridors bend unnaturally, forming loops and dead ends that confuse the senses.
        Dust rises with every step, and the floors creak like they're whispering warnings.
    </p>

    <h3>Cabin Design</h3>
    <p>
        The rooms are filled with moving portraits, shivering curtains, and faint illusions that shift 
        as you walk past. Hidden speakers send distant footsteps echoing behind you, even when 
        no one is there. A faint smell of old wood and cold stone fills the air, giving the entire manor 
        an unsettling sense of reality.
    </p>

    <h3>Environment and Atmosphere</h3>
    <p>
        Thick fog wraps around the outside courtyard, glowing faintly under dim blue lights.  
        Animatronic ravens perch on broken fences, cawing into the night.  
        Occasionally, a sudden gust of wind shakes the trees—even when the air is still.  
        Many guests linger outside after the ride, shivering not from cold, but from the feeling that 
        something followed them out.
