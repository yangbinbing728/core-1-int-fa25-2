   <h1>The Luminous Wheel Zone</h1>
   <p>Welcome to the calm heart of the park — a space where movement turns into light.
The Luminous Wheel Zone is designed for those who seek peace after the thrill. The entire area glows in gentle colors that change with time, reflecting on water and glass. Soft music plays in the background, and the air feels lighter here, as if everything is floating. Visitors come not only to ride the wheel, but to watch it — to see how light can slow down time.

The Celestial Orbit takes you high above the park, inside crystal cabins that glow with soft blue light. Below, the world becomes a sea of color and sound, fading gently as you rise. It’s not just a Ferris wheel — it’s a journey into stillness, where you can touch the horizon and feel the sky breathe with you.</p>

    <h3>Appearance and structure</h3>
   </head>
<body>
    <p>The Luminous Wheel stands quietly at the edge of the park, taller than any other structure. Its frame isn’t made of ordinary metal — it’s a circle of light, woven from hundreds of transparent beams that shimmer like glass. In the sunlight, it almost disappears into the sky; at night, it becomes a glowing halo suspended above the ground. The spokes stretch out in smooth, geometric lines, forming a perfect symmetry that looks both delicate and infinite.</p>

    <h3>Cabin design</h3>
   </head>
<body>
  <p> Inside the cabins, the seats curve like petals around a glowing center. Visitors sit facing outward, surrounded by 360° transparent walls. A soft hum fills the space — the sound of quiet engines and distant music. The cabin’s light changes with height: cool blue when rising, warm gold when descending. From the top, you can see the entire park shining below like a constellation of color. For a moment, it feels like floating between earth and stars.   </p></section>

    <h3>Environment and atmosphere</h3>
   </head>
<body>
  <p>The base of the wheel is surrounded by a shallow reflecting pool. The structure’s lights ripple on the water’s surface, breaking and reforming with every breeze. Low mist drifts across the pool, and stepping stones lead to the boarding platform, which glows faintly like a path of starlight. Soft instrumental music plays in the background — not loud, but enough to make the air feel alive.</p></section></body>
