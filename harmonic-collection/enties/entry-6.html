    <h1>The Tempest Voyager</h1>
   <p>Sail through the storm of light and motion!
The Tempest Voyager swings above a glowing sea, its metallic hull shining like liquid silver. Each rise feels like defying gravity, and each fall crashes into waves of mist and laughter. It’s not just a pirate ship — it’s a voyage through wind, rhythm, and courage.</p>

   <small><p>Drift into the ocean of light.
The Tempest Voyager doesn’t just swing — it sails through the air like a ship lost between worlds. Its sails shimmer with pale blue light, and every movement leaves a trail of silver mist behind. The air smells faintly of salt and rain, and for a moment, it feels like floating above a living sea. It’s a quiet storm — beautiful, weightless, endless.</p></small>

    <h3>Appearance and structure</h3>
   </head>
<body> The Tempest Voyager rises from the center of a vast water basin, suspended between two towering steel arcs shaped like breaking waves. The ship itself gleams with metallic wood grain — a fusion of iron and oak, carved with faint glowing runes that pulse like heartbeat. The bow curves high, crowned with a glass compass that spins slowly even when the ship is still. When it swings, the entire structure looks like it’s slicing through invisible tides, caught between gravity and freedom.</body>

    <h3>Cabin design</h3>
   </head>
<body>Inside, the air hums with the low roar of engines disguised as ocean wind. The wooden benches are smooth and cool to the touch, etched with compass symbols that glow faintly as the ship moves. As the swing begins, your body feels weightless — a rush of air, a spark of fear, a burst of laughter. The moment it reaches its peak, time seems to freeze — just you, hanging above the glowing water, caught between storm and silence.</body>

    <h3>Environment and atmosphere</h3>
   </head>
<body>Around the ride, waves of light roll across the shallow pool, echoing the motion of the ship. Mechanical seagulls made of silver drift above, their wings glinting in rhythm with the swinging arc. Visitors stand at the edge, reflected in rippling blue — some cheering, others just watching, drawn by the strange beauty of balance and chaos.</body>
