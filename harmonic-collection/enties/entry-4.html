    <h1>The Celestial Carousel</h1>
   <p>Glowing with starlight and soft music, the Celestial Carousel turns like a dream in motion. Each shining creature moves in gentle rhythm, carrying you through a world where time slows and every spin feels like a wish come true.</p>

  <small><p>When night falls, the world begins to drift.
The Celestial Carousel turns slowly under a sky of floating lights. Each horse shines with a soft glow, its mane made of silver threads that ripple as the music plays. The air feels lighter here — filled with warmth, laughter, and a hint of starlight. As you rise and fall with the rhythm, the whole park seems to fade away.
It’s not just a ride — it’s a dream you can touch.</p></small>

    <h3>Appearance and structure</h3>
   </head>
<body>
   The Celestial Carousel stands at the heart of the park, glowing softly like a dream that never ends. Its roof spirals upward in layers of translucent glass and light, resembling a floating crown in motion. Instead of the traditional canopy, thousands of fiber-light threads hang down like starlight, swaying gently as the platform turns. From above, it looks like a slow-spinning galaxy — elegant, calm, and timeless.

 Soft music flows from invisible speakers — a mix of piano, wind chimes, and distant echoes. Riders can feel the gentle rhythm beneath their feet as the platform turns. The air smells faintly of vanilla and ozone, like memory mixed with light rain. When you look around, the world slows down: laughter becomes melody, motion becomes rhythm. It’s not about thrill — it’s about drifting through a memory that feels alive.

    <h3>Environment and atmosphere</h3>
   </head>
<body>
 The carousel is surrounded by a ring of glowing trees whose leaves shimmer like holograms. Beneath them, the ground reflects the ride’s lights in rippling patterns, creating the illusion of floating in a shallow sea of stars. A faint mist drifts over the area, softening every sound. Visitors often stop here between rides, drawn by the calm — a moment to breathe, to watch, to feel.
