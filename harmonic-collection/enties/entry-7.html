        The Ember Drop is not just a freefall — it’s a moment of suspended fire.
        Rising like a glowing torch in the center of the park, this drop tower mixes fear and beauty into one breathtaking plunge.
        Each ride is a dance between gravity and flame.

        As the tower rises, red and amber lights swirl through its glass veins.
        At the very top, silence falls — then everything gives way to speed, color, and fire.

      <h2>Appearance and Structure</h2>
      <p>
        The Ember Drop stands tall like a column of molten glass. Its frame glows from within, filled with flowing streams of light that twist upward in rhythmic waves.
        At its peak, the ride pauses for just a heartbeat — long enough for riders to feel weightless before the plunge begins.

      <h2>Material and Light</h2>
      <p>
        The tower’s outer shell is a fusion of reflective steel and translucent crystal panels.
        During the day, it mirrors the clouds and sunlight; at night, it becomes a living flame, pulsing with orange, red, and violet tones.
        Inside, glowing energy lines trace the ride’s motion like veins of fire.

      <h2>Rider Experience</h2>
      <p>
        The seats form a circular ring facing outward, giving every rider a full panoramic view.
        A soft vibration hums through the seat as energy builds beneath you.
        Then — silence. A second later, you fall through a storm of color and light, the wind roaring past like a living flame.

      <h2>Environment and Atmosphere</h2>
      <p>
        Around the tower lies a shallow pool of reflective water, glowing softly with the tower’s fiery light.
        Thin mist rises from the surface, curling in the air like smoke.
        Each drop sends ripples across the pool, lighting it up in bursts of orange and gold — a firestorm reflected in water.
