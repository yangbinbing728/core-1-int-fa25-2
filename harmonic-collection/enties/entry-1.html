  <small><p>Step into the future of speed.
The Velocity Loop isn’t made of steel — it’s made of light. As you ride, holographic tunnels flash around you, changing color with every heartbeat. Gravity bends, time stretches, and for a moment, you forget where the ground is.</p></small>

    <h3>Appearance and structure</h3>
   </head>
<body>
   The Storm Track rises like a silver skeleton against the sky. Its frame twists and coils in midair, made of shining metal beams that catch every bit of light. From a distance, it looks almost alive — like a giant steel serpent frozen in motion. The track loops over itself several times, forming spirals that seem impossible for gravity to allow. At night, the entire structure glows faintly, as if electricity runs through its veins.

    <h3>Cabin design</h3>
   </head>
<body>
   The passenger cars are shaped like aerodynamic capsules, sleek and sharp-edged, with translucent shells that let riders see the world rushing past. The seats are suspended slightly above the base, creating the illusion of floating. Inside, soft blue light fills the cabin, and small holographic symbols flicker across the dashboard. It feels less like boarding a coaster and more like entering a futuristic aircraft.

    <h3>Environment and atmosphere</h3>
   </head>
<body>
   Around the coaster, artificial mist machines release thin clouds that swirl around the base of the structure. When the lights hit the fog, it creates a glowing storm-like halo — the reason behind its name. Electric sounds echo through hidden speakers: the crackle of thunder, the whoosh of wind. Even before the ride starts, the atmosphere already feels charged, as if a storm is about to break.
